2023_08_27_julie/clip_12_01/lt.mp4,551,684,The patient would need an appropriate regimen of anti-seizure drugs and a follow-up on what's causing the mental status change.,4
2023_08_27_julie/clip_12_03/lt.mp4,18,133," In this clip, again, the providers are setting up to intubate the patient or place a breathing tube, likely given that the patient has altered mental status.",4
2023_08_27_julie/clip_12_03/lt.mp4,133,241,"We are preparing with medications and a CMAQ, and it would be important to ensure that the intubation goes smoothly.",4
2023_08_27_julie/clip_12_05/lt.mp4,8,341," The patient now appears to be intubated, so it would be important to see the markers of correct placement, so listening over the patient's chest, watching for color change on the end tidal CO2 monitor to watch the patient's oxygen saturations and hemodynamics to ensure that the intubation was done properly.",4
2023_08_27_julie/clip_12_06/lt.mp4,21,188," In this clip, the patient is post-intubation, so it would be important to monitor the patient's oxygenation status, hemodynamic status, and mental status to see if there's any improvements.",4
2023_08_27_julie/clip_12_07/lt.mp4,6,105," In this clip, the patient is now intubated and is needing quite a bit of medication to keep blood pressure up.",4
2023_08_27_julie/clip_12_07/lt.mp4,105,200,So it would be important to monitor hemodynamic status and administer medications to help regulate that as needed.,4

2023_08_27_julie/clip_12_08/lt.mp4,211,299,And it seems they're setting up to put an arterial line so they can monitor hemodynamics and pull blood gases and other blood work off the line.,4
2023_08_27_julie/clip_12_09/lt.mp4,6,197," In this clip, it looks like an arterial line is being set up to be placed, which would mean that we could monitor the patient's hemodynamics and adjust medications accordingly, since it seems the patient is needing frequent pushes of medications to keep blood pressure up.",4
