2023_08_16_trish/clip_01_01/lt.mp4,254,280,The patient appears awake and alert.,4
2023_08_16_trish/clip_08/lt.mp4,31,82, Chint is receiving a nebulizer treatment via her trach.,4
2023_08_16_trish/clip_11/lt.mp4,27,141, The nurse is administering medications to the patient via the patient's feeding tube.,4
2023_08_16_trish/clip_17_01/lt.mp4,20,152, This is performing trait care by suctioning the patient's tracheostomy and exchanging the inner cannula.,4
2023_08_16_trish/clip_17_01/lt.mp4,152,310,The nurse also wipes the surrounding area of the patient's tracheostomy.,4
2023_08_16_trish/clip_17_01/lt.mp4,310,351,The nurse also applies a roof monitor to the patient.,4
2023_08_16_trish/clip_18_01/lt.mp4,36,205, Patient is fully dependent on the nurse for repositioning and is unable to provide any assistance in repositioning.,4
2023_08_16_trish/clip_19/lt.mp4,18,126, Patient has a weak cough in response to deep suctioning via her tracheostomy.,4
2023_08_16_trish/clip_19/lt.mp4,126,162,The patient tolerated the suctioning well.,4
2023_08_16_trish/clip_22/lt.mp4,24,152, This appears to be having trouble administering the patient's enteral medications via the feeding tube.,4
2023_08_16_trish/clip_22/lt.mp4,152,332,It appears there may be a clog that is slowing down the nurse's ability to push the medications through the feeding tube.,4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_03/lt.mp4,7,143," In this clip, it seems the nurse is having a difficult time getting a temperature reading on the patient, so it would be important to know what the temperature is to make sure the patient isn't septic.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_05/lt.mp4,14,92," In this clip, the nurse is assessing breath sounds, heart tones, and abdominal sounds.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_05/lt.mp4,92,201,So it would be important to know the findings of those and relay that information to the physician if it's outside of the desired limits.,4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_06/lt.mp4,22,185," The nurse in this clip is placing a barrier on the patient, which could potentially indicate that the patient is hypothermic and could be having a cold sepsis.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_06/lt.mp4,185,242,So it would be important to monitor the patient's temperature to make sure he's recovering.,4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_07_01/lt.mp4,5,112," In this clip, the providers are setting up to put in an invasive line, either an arterial line or a central access line.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_07_01/lt.mp4,112,169,So it would be important to assist with the setup of that.,4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_07_01/lt.mp4,169,226,"And if it's an arterial line, monitor the hemodynamics once the arterial line is placed.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_07_02/lt.mp4,5,143," In this clip, the provider appears to be setting up to insert an arterial line, so it would be important to know how that procedure went, assuming there would be no difficulty.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_07_02/lt.mp4,143,271,"And once the arterial line is in, it would be important to monitor hemodynamics in this patient to assess if the patient needs further intervention.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_08_01/lt.mp4,7,156," The provider here is setting up to insert an arterial line, so it would be important to make sure that the procedure goes well and once the arterial line is inserted to monitor the patient's hemodynamics.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_08_06/lt.mp4,21,73," In this clip, the bedside alarm is alarming and flashing.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_08_06/lt.mp4,73,166,"However, I cannot see what the number shows, but I'm assuming the blood pressure is low.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_08_06/lt.mp4,166,220,"The nurse is hanging a bag of medication, which I presume would be pressors.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_08_06/lt.mp4,220,333,"If this is the case, it would be important to know the patient's hemodynamics and his response to medication.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_08_07/lt.mp4,13,94," Nerves in this clip appears to be starting a medication, presumably pressors, to increase the patient's blood pressure.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_08_07/lt.mp4,94,193,So it would be important to know the needed titration for that to keep the patient within its hemodynamic parameters.,4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_08_09/lt.mp4,9,189," The arterial line was successfully placed, therefore we can start closely hemodynamic monitoring this patient as directed by the patient's physician orders or parameters.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_13_03/lt.mp4,3,115," In this clip, the chest x-ray was taken, so it would be important for follow-up on the result of the chest x-ray.",4
2023_08_23_julie/clip_13_03/lt.mp4,115,276,"It also seems that this patient has lost IV access or is bleeding from the IV, so we need to replace the IV so that he has adequate access for medications.",4
